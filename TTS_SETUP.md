# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Setup Guide

## Overview

Trelby now includes text-to-speech functionality powered by LMNT, allowing you to have your screenplays read aloud with different voices for different characters.

## Features

- **Table Read**: Read entire screenplays with character-specific voices
- **Voice Mapping**: Assign different voices to characters
- **Real-time Progress**: Track reading progress with visual feedback
- **Voice Settings**: Configure narrator, male, female, and character-specific voices
- **Audio Playback**: Actual audio output (with optional audio libraries)

## Setup

### 1. Get LMNT API Key

1. Visit [LMNT](https://lmnt.com/)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Add the key to your `.env` file:
   ```
   LMNT_API_KEY=your_actual_lmnt_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Optional Audio Libraries

For actual audio playback, install one of these libraries:

```bash
# Option 1: Pygame (recommended for cross-platform)
pip install pygame

# Option 2: PyAudio (alternative)
pip install pyaudio
```

If no audio library is installed, the system will simulate playback (useful for testing).

## Usage

### Basic Table Read

1. Open Trelby and load a screenplay
2. Click the **Table Read (TTS)** button in the toolbar (ðŸ“– icon)
3. The Table Read dialog will open with three tabs:
   - **Reading**: Start/stop reading and view progress
   - **Voice Settings**: Configure default voices
   - **Character Mapping**: Assign specific voices to characters

### Voice Configuration

#### Default Voices
- **Narrator/Action**: Voice for scene descriptions and action lines
- **Male Characters**: Default voice for male characters
- **Female Characters**: Default voice for female characters
- **Young Characters**: Voice for young characters
- **Old Characters**: Voice for older characters

#### Character-Specific Voices
- Each character in your screenplay can be assigned a specific voice
- Available voices: burt, donna, harry, lisa
- Characters without specific assignments use the default voice for their type

### Reading Options

- **Reading Speed**: Adjust how fast the text is read (50-200%)
- **Pause Between Segments**: Control pauses between dialogue and action

## Testing

Run the test script to verify your setup:

```bash
python test_tts.py
```

This will check:
- LMNT API key configuration
- TTS service connectivity
- Audio player initialization
- Text processing functionality

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure `LMNT_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
- Check that the API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Verify internet connectivity

### Audio Playback Issues
- Install pygame or pyaudio for actual audio output
- Check system audio settings
- On Linux, you may need additional audio libraries
